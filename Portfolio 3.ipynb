    "## Predicting the Genre of Books from Summaries\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use a set of book summaries from the [CMU Book Summaries Corpus](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dbamman/booksummaries.html) in this experiment.  This contains a large number of summaries (16,559) and includes meta-data about the genre of the books taken from Freebase.  Each book can have more than one genre and there are 227 genres listed in total.  To simplify the problem of genre prediction we will select a small number of target genres that occur frequently in the collection and select the books with these genre labels.  This will give us one genre label per book. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your goal in this portfolio is to take this data and build predictive models to classify the books into one of the five target genres.  You will need to extract suitable features from the texts and select suitable models to classify them. You should build and evaluate at least TWO models and compare the prediction results.\n",
